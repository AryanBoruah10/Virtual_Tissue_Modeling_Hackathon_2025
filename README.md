# Virtual_Tissue_Modeling_Hackathon_2025
Build a virtual 3D Epithelial folding Model using CompuCell3D.
We were interested in understanding the biomecahnics of uterine epithelial tissue folding. 

Epithelial folding is a key developmental process where flat cell sheets transform into 3D structures through forces like apical constriction, basal expansion, and differential adhesion. Our cc3d model will help reveal how these local cellular mechanics combine to drive large-scale shape changes. By simulating different parameters, models can test hypotheses, predict tissue behavior under perturbations, and guide experiments - offering a clearer understanding of the folding process.
